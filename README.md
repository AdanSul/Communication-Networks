# Communication Networks

This repository contains solutions and explanations for key questions related to communication networks, covering topics such as wireless protocols, queue theory, routing, and TCP analysis. Below is a brief outline of the questions and their explanations:


## Question 1: Wireless Protocols
Analyzes a wireless network using different protocols, including Pure ALOHA, CSMA, and Slotted ALOHA. Topics include network throughput, efficiency, and protocol upgrades.


## Question 3: Queue Theory
Examines queue models with finite and infinite capacities, focusing on probabilities, system stability, and throughput.


## Question 4: Routing and Link State Protocol
Analyzes a network routing scenario using link-state and distance-vector protocols, focusing on shortest paths, spanning trees, and edge classifications.


## Question 5: ARQ Protocol (Stop-and-Wait)
Enhances the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol, introducing mechanisms to improve efficiency and reduce redundant transmissions.


## Question 6: TCP Protocol and Analysis
Investigates TCP behavior in controlled scenarios, focusing on flow control, congestion handling, and protocol efficiency.


## Lab Question: TCP Traffic Analysis
Includes practical analysis of TCP traffic using `Wireshark`, focusing on connection setup, congestion control, retransmissions, and throughput evaluation under different network conditions.
